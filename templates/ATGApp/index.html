        <p>
            This site has been created so that avid football suporters and newcomers alike can share their experiences of the football matches they have attended.
            <br/>
            <br/>Without an account, you will be able to see information about the Stadiums and the reviews people have left about their experiences there.
            <br/>However if you want to leave your own review on a stadium, you will need to register an account with the site.
